## Details

**Hiring Manager** - Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart  

**Where** - Mid-Peninsula, San Francisco Bay Area (Redwood Shores or possibly downtown Palo Alto)  
**When** - Ideally January (Winter Break in some schools) with some flexibility around the boundaries.  
**How Long** - 10 weeks  
**Openings** - 3 or 4

**Qualifications** - Students with CS/Software interest. I am *very* flexible on what year in College/GradSchool/HighSchool they are but  they **must** be sharp and solid developers or *very* fast learners as we have very little time.  Check out the [Summer2014][] and [Winter2015][] projects for an idea of what interns accomplished then.  

**Technologies** - Varies with the project topic.  For exampe, during the [Summer2014][] none of the interns knew Node.js but they all were somewhat familiar with Javascript and with Unix programming so they picked it up fairly quicky.  

## Topics
Specific topics will be adjusted based on the candidate but the current pool includes:

* Upgrading our samples to Microsoft Band, Apple HomeKit, Apple Watch and Apple WatchKit, Android Wear, etc
* Starting to generate Docker samples
* Some more Node.js samples with AddOns and other modules
* Incorporating KendoUI into the samples
* Using Rollbase as a backend for some Sitefinity deployments.
* Some samples using NativeScript.

Plus some ideas related to the pending Telerik acquisition.
