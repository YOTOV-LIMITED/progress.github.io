## Previously: HackMIT 2015

The 2015 event was Sep 19 and 20th, 2015.  Fun was had by all; see [Web Page](hackMIT_2015), the [summary post](https://pelegri.wordpress.com/2015/10/11/hackmit-sep-2015/) and this [Flickr Album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42919418@N03/sets/72157658949478492)

## Logistics

Last year, the venue for [HackMIT](https://hackmit.org) was the [Kresge Auditorium and the Johnson Ice Rink](https://goo.gl/maps/n5wnbgbBorB2); I expect it will be the same this year.  Dates are Sep 17th and 19th, 2016.
 
## API Prizes

There will be prizes but we are still figuring out what they are.
