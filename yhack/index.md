# Products Most Relevant to YHack

Progress has a number of products; the ones that are most likely relevant to the attendees at YHack are Modulus, Rollbase and Rollbase Mobile.

## Modulus (tm)
Modulus is a Node.js hosting platform that provides a complete technology stack for application developers. This includes custom SSL, WebSockets, MongoDB, statistics, and [more](https://modulus.io/features).
There are a number of [AddOns available](http://addons.modulus.io),
including [Searchly](https://addons.modulus.io/searchly), [IronWorker](https://addons.modulus.io/searchly),
[KeenIO](https://addons.modulus.io/searchly), [IronMQ](https://addons.modulus.io/searchly)
and [SendGrid](https://addons.modulus.io/searchly).
Note that all these addons have a free entry level.  There are also over 103K modules at [NPM](http://npmjs.org).

You can learn more about Modulus from the [Modulus blog](http://blog.modulus.io)
and the [Modulus Help Page](http://help.modulus.io).

Using Modulus requires loging in, which can be done with your Github id, or with a Modulus account.
Modulus [registration](https://modulus.io/register) automatically gives you $15 free Modulus credit, about one month;
attendees at YHack can use **promo** _YHACKS14_ worth $30 Modulus credits.

**Samples** - You can find multiple useful open source samples at [github.com/onmodulus](http://github.com/onmodulus).
Node and MongoDB are widely used in the internet; an internet search will likely find you a sample of pretty much 
anything you are interested in.

## Rollbase
Rollbase is a cloud platform for the rapid creation and deployment of applications.  Rollbase applications are built
by defininig object types with fields from different sources, and views and pages to interact on objects, with support
for triggers, workflow, javascript actions, and more.  Depending on your background, you will recognize features present in
[Force.com](http://force.com), or in [Parse](http://parse.com).

Rollbase is used through a cloud tool delivered on your favorite browser.   You will need an account; registration is
[here](https://www.progress.com/trynow) and includes a free 30 day tryout.

For a description of the Rollbase features check this [overview of features](https://www.progress.com/products/rollbase/features),
the [detailed documentation site](http://documentation.progress.com/output/Rollbase/index.html). Keegan had used Parse previously
and adapted to Rollbase very quickly; check his [writeup](http://mendoncakeegan.wordpress.com/2014/08/22/angular-rollbase-blog/).

If you want really detailed info on Rollbase (and Rollbase Mobile), check the [Exchange 2014 tracks](https://community.progress.com/community_groups/user_conferences/w/exchange/2328.exchange-2014-breakout-sessions.aspx#Track1).

**Samples** - You can find multiple open source samples at [github.com/progress](http://github.com/progress).  They cover
Rollbase, Node, Mongo, ExpressJS, AngularJS, IOT (Philips Hue and iBeacons) and others.  You can also find additional information
in the blogs of [David Inglis](http://dcinglis.wordpress.com) and [Keegan Mendoca](http://mendoncakeegan.wordpress.com)

## Rollbase Mobile
Rollbase Mobile is an online tool that can be used to create hybrid mobile apps using
[Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org).
The tool uses the same
registration as Rollbase (the overall brand is called Pacific).
The direct link to the tool is [here](https://mobile.rollbase.com).

Rollbase Mobile also includes several server-side services. Detailed documentation on Rollbase Mobile is [here](http://docs.mobile.rollbase.com/tutorials/).

# Samples

The samples at [github.com/onmodulus](http://github.com/onmodulus)
and [github.com/progress](http://github.com/progress) may provide inspiration and initial code for multiple projects including:

* Samples from the Absolute Beginners Guide - [guide](https://github.com/onmodulus/absolute-beginners-guide-nodejs)
* A Simple Demo - [demo](https://github.com/onmodulus/modulus-demo)
* A Simple Network Queue - [queue](https://github.com/onmodulus/simple-queue)
* A Real-Time Editor using PubNub and Modulus - [sample](https://github.com/onmodulus/realtime-editor)

and

* An xCode sample to monitor and range iBeacons - [Scanner](https://github.com/progress/ios-beacon-scanner)
* A Rollcall using iBeacons, iOS, Node, MongoDB and Philips Hue - [Rollcall](https://github.com/progress/roll-call)
* A Blogging sample using AngularJS, Express and Rollbase - [Blog](https://github.com/progress/angular-rollbase-blog)

The samples in github.com/progress cover a fair range of architectures.   You may want to check some presentations
mentioned [here](http://pelegri.wordpress.com/2014/10/27/latest-presentations-at-slideshare/).

# YHack Challenge
We welcome any hacks that use at least one of our products.  We are making the iBeacons and the Philips Hue available
to encourage you to play with these IOT elements but you do not need to use them.

Modulus, with NOde.js and MongoDB is useful in **many** contexts.

iBeacons can be used with the Gimbal devices but other devices (like iOS, Mac and Android) also support Bluetooth Low Energy
and can also be used.

Rollbase Mobile can be used to quickly put together a Hybrid app.

ROllbase can be used to model objects and handle authentication and then to quickly generate dashboards and other applications, potentially using the Web API to drive a mobile application.


# Additional Learning Links

**Node.js** - There are many learning resources.  On the Modulus side check out[An Absolute Beginnger's Guide to Node.js](http://blog.modulus.io/absolute-beginners-guide-to-nodejs), and several posts on [ExpressJS](http://blog.modulus.io/tag/express) and [Hapi](http://blog.modulus.io/tag/hapi).  Several of our samples also use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org), which is a very popular client-side framework.

**iBeacons** - Apple has a fair amount of documentation; see [iBeacon for Developers](https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/).  The Gimbal portal has documentation including how to activate the beacons; you will need to register and login [here](http://manager.gimbal.com).  Also see the [scanner](https://github.com/progress/ios-beacon-scanner) and the [roll-call](https://github.com/progress/roll-call) samples.

**Philips Hue** - Documentation is available [here](http://www.developers.meethue.com/). ALso see the [roll-call](https://github.com/progress/roll-call) sample.

# Lending Library Resources  

## iBeacon:
   The beacons can be borrowed for the duration of the event. THey are Qualcom Gimbal Series 10.  They will be handed out at midnight on Friday; you will need to provide a description of what you are planning to do with them as we have a lmite number of them.

## Philips Hue Bridge
   We have 2 [Philips Hue Starter Kits](http://store.apple.com/us/product/HFV02VC/A/philips-hue-lux-starter-pack) (bridge + 2 monochrome lights) that we can lend.  Coordinate with Shelley and Jeremiah and be ready to share with other teams.

You will need to provide contact info by mailing SHelley or Jeremiah with:

* CC everybody in the team,  
* Team Number / location and Team Name (if you have one)  
* Initial idea / area of what you plan to do with the resource.  
* For each member of the team, please provide full name, school, major and year  

# Resources on Completion of Project
   You can keep your Qualcomm Gimbal at the end of the hackathon once you are done.
   We need the Philips Hue back.
   
# Judging
Hacks will be judged on originality, technical difficulty, and applicability.  Hacks need to leverage at least one of the Progress offerings.

Main judges are Jeremiah and Shelley.  Please be sure the judges are aware your hack is targetting this content.


# Prizes:
   All teams that complete their hack can keep their Qualcom Gimbals  

   The prizes are:

* 2 [BeagleBone Blacks](http://beaglebone.org/black) - Linux, HDMI, Ethernet, USB, ARM Cortex-A8 1GHz. Fun!
* At the discretion of the judges we may allocate **additional prizes**, including larger credits for running on the MOdulus and Rollbase platforms.

# Come by, say hi, get some SWAG
