# Overview
The progressNEXT app is a mobile app (iOS and Android) written using Progress technology.  The mobile app itself is a hybrid app (Apache Cordova / PhoneGap).  The backend store and some server-side functionality is in Rollbase.  The notification service is that of the Telerik Platform.  Modulus is used to host several small apps and as router and glue.  The mobile app was designed using the Telerik Platform tools.

# Support for ProgressNEXT App
If you encounter issues, please email the support alias [progressnextapp@progress.com](mailto:progressnextapp@progress.com)

# Where to download the App
The progressNEXT is available in Google Play and in the iTunes store; it is published by Progress Software.

# What's about some secret functionality?
We have been working on an extra feature related to the app.  It's very much a stretch goal; keep your fingers crossed and stay tuned.

# Authorship
The progressNEXT app was written in partnership by [JungleLasers](http://www.geo30.com/) and Progress.

We plan to open source the code for the app.  Mail [progressnextapp@progress.com](mailto:progressnextapp@progress.com) if you are interested in being notified when this happens. 

# Evolution of the App
We started developing the app very late in November and, as in any fast-moving development, we have a number of RFEs and cleanup items in our list.  Your feedback and interest would help us prioritize the development of these features.

The next version of the app will use NativeScript.

# Other TODO
The template used by this microsite needs to be updated to include also the Telerik and NativeScript logos
